# TwoWayANCOVA
 This package finds test statistic value and corresponding critical value of parametric bootstrap based Likelihood ratio test,             two simltaneous tests TN and TM for testing equality of row effects against ordered alternatives in two-way ANCOVA model without interaction and            with heteroscedasticity. It also finds maximum likelihood estimators of parameters of a two-way ANCOVA model (without interaction) in two cases:             (i) treatment effects of one factor are equal and (ii) treatment  effects of one factor are in simple order restrictions.            Further, it finds simultaneous confidence intervals for differences of successive treatment effects.
